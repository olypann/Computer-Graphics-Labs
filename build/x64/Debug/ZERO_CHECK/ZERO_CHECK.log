  CMake is re-running because D:/Computer-Graphics-Labs/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp is out-of-date.
    the file 'D:/Computer-Graphics-Labs/external/rpavlik-cmake-modules-fe2273/CleanDirectoryList.cmake'
    is newer than 'D:/Computer-Graphics-Labs/build/CMakeFiles/generate.stamp.depend'

  CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:2 (cmake_minimum_required):
    Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
    CMake.
  
    Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
    CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.

  CMake Deprecation Warning at external/glfw-3.1.2/CMakeLists.txt:8 (cmake_policy):
    The OLD behavior for policy CMP0042 will be removed from a future version
    of CMake.
  
    The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
    policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
    specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
    behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.
